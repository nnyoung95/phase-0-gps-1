*The git concepts I struggled with the most before our GPS1.1 was the git add code. This code is tagged along by the filename you wish too add, and I would continuously forget too add the filename. After this lesson it is stamped on my brain that filename follows git add command.
*The concept that got a lot of clarification in my opinion was the entire process of adding, committing, and pushing information too GitHub. 
*The main questions I asked my pair were questions about preferance for commit messages. Other than that I definitely asked my guide questions about codes and specifics. 
*The things that still confuse me about Git is sometimes I am lost where I am in the terminal. To be more specific, I am lost where some information is stored. I know that we work on feature branches, but when we use git add, is the file being added to our feature branch? I later verified this with my guide whom was a lot of help.
*My first experience with GPS was very good! My partner was very helpful and seemed to have a good grasp on the knowledge we have learned over the previous weeks. Also our guide was super helpful and definitely educated in the field. I look forward to my next GPS next week and learning new material.
